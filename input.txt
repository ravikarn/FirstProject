Instructions to Run-
--------------------------------
1.Provide a valid file path to the processInput method of StartWar.java class.
2.File path should be a path of single input file instance of a single test case.

Assumptions-
------------------
All the constraints given in problem statement is followed, as no verification is done in code for input.

Test Cases-
--------------------------
Total five sample input files are taken for JUnit testing suit.
We can assert our code by verifying the return from processInput method of StartWar.java class.
There can be 3 possible outcome as "Player-1" ,"Player-2" or "DRAW". On basis of valid input file , we can assert the winner as the outcome of our class.

Solution design-
-------------------------------
In solution four methods are there. Brief description is as follows-

a). gamePlayPrinters-
This method will print the logs during game play.

b). generateDecodingMap-
This method will create and fill a map having key value pair as A=1,B=2, ... so on. It will be used for decoding the target area for missiles.

c). processInput-
This method will take input from file and create a 2 dimensional array for both the players and pass the attack plan and 2-D array to startGame method.

d). startGame-
